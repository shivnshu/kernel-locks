What is inside?
---------------

1. module: A kernel module that provides a chardev interface to test and measure 
   synchronization performance. It can be extended to implement custom synchronization
   constructs.

2. ksync_bench.c:  User-space program to test the correctness and efficiency of underlying
   synchronization implementation

How to compile?
---------------

$ make
   creates module syncdev.ko and user executable syncbench

How to run?
-----------

1. sudo su

2. # insmod module/syncdev.ko
    
    -- check that a new sysfs entry is created i.e., /sys/kernel/asg2_lock
       and its initial value is zero (0)

3. execute dmesg and find the exact mknod command
   e.g., # mknod /dev/syncdev c 246 0

NOTE: Steps 1 to 3 are performed only when you have changed something in the module 

4. Change the lock type by changing the sysfs entry (asg2_lock),
   Different lock type values are as follows,
 
   SPINLOCK = 1

   RWLOCK = 2               /*kernel read/write lock*/
   SEQLOCK = 3                /*kernel seqlock*/
   RCU = 4                    /*kernel RCU*/
   RWLOCK_CUSTOM = 5          /*Your custom read/write lock*/
   RESEARCH_LOCK = 6        /*To improve over RCU*/


   e.g., to use spin locks, execute
   echo 1 > /sys/kernel/asg2_lock
 
5. execute 
           # ./syncbench <numthreads> <ops/thread> <readops (%)> <writeops (%)>
          
           e.g., #./syncbench 8 5000000 99 1

          Successful execution will print total and per thread CPU cycles when the above 
          program terminates

How to implement new locks?
---------------------------

In the current implementation two types of lock implementation exist.
  
  (i)  no locking  (asg2_lock = 0)
  (ii) kernel spinlock is used (asg2_lock = 1). 

Refer to LOCK_TYPE enum in module/syncdev.c for different locks to be
implemented. 

To add a new lock type (synchronization method, either kernel provided or custom) 
following changes are to be done.

1. add the lock in  struct cs_handler -> union (@line #52)

2. provide implementations for init_cs, read_data, write_data and cleanup_cs

3. Make sure your implementation of read_data and write_data invokes mustcall_read and mustcall_write, respectively. (See line #56 and spinlock implementation) 

4. In set_cs_implementation() function, fill the appropriate case (in switch-case construct) with your implementation.
 
5. recompile the module

5. unload the module if already loaded:   #rm -f /dev/syncdev  
#rmmod syncdev.ko

6. Follow "How to run" steps to test the newly implemented lock

Sample executions with/without synchronization are available in runs.txt.

Note that some test cases will pass even without locking.
A test case failure results in an abort due to inconsistent shared state. 
Check read and write implementations in the kernel module.
